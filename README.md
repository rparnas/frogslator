Translation patch creation utility for カエルの為に鐘は鳴る (For the Frog the Bell Tolls)

**NOTE: If you used the original version of this program to save a .frog translation file, the latest version will not read it. You can contact me on GitHub or at user 'ryanbgstl' on the ROMHacking.Net forums if you need assistance updating an old translation.**
